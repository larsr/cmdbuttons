# cmdbuttons

Run it with the python package installer [`uvx`][install_uv] like this

    uvx  git+https://github.com/larsr/cmdbuttons.git

It opens a window that shows the configured buttons and the stdout the commands produce when they are run.

- Run the command by clicking the button.

- If you press SHIFT while clicking, it doesn't run the command, but fills in the name and command. 
  That is useful if you want to edit it (press `+`), or remove it (press `-`).
